Visual Product Matcher: Project Approach
My approach was to build a full-stack visual search application using a modern, efficient technology stack suitable for rapid development and deployment.

Core Technology & AI Model
The core of the system is a pre-trained AI model, OpenAI's CLIP, which generates numerical vector embeddings for images. This allows for a "zero-shot" similarity search without needing to train a custom model, making it ideal for a time-constrained project.

Backend
The backend is a lightweight and asynchronous FastAPI server. It performs a one-time pre-processing step to generate and cache embeddings for all products. When a user uploads an image, the API generates its embedding on-the-fly and uses cosine similarity to find the closest matches in the cached data, returning a sorted lis results.

Frontend
The frontend is a responsive single-page application built with React and TypeScript, providing a polished, dark-mode user experience for image uploads t ofand interactive results display.

Deployment
For deployment, I implemented a decoupled architecture. The FastAPI backend is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces to handle the AI model's memory requirements, while the static React frontend is deployed to Vercel for performance. The image and vector data are hosted in a separate public GitHub repository, ensuring a fast and lightweight deployment process for the core application..
